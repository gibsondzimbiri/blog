# blog
This is a blog created using Laravel
It is a project about the blog that enables registered users to send a post and once sent it will be read by the administrator before it is published.
You can create your own database, make all the configurations as required, and run php artisan migrate to create the tables. In the users table set your account access level to 1 so that you become a super administrator.
